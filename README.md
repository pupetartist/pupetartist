A results-driven software engineering leader with over 8 years of experience building and scaling world-class products. I have a proven track record of success leading back-end and front-end development for high-growth technology companies, including guiding two Mexican unicorns—Konfio and Stori Card—and one soonicorn, Fondeadora, through critical growth phases. 

As Stori Card’s 3rd engineer, I established the foundations for their core product and helped propel the company to become a fintech leader in Latin America. I excel at architecting scalable solutions, optimizing system performance, and ensuring reliability and security for mission-critical platforms. 

With the full support of my employers, I have also pursued select freelance and consulting projects, which have allowed me to gain valuable experience across industries and technologies. By balancing these side projects with my primary roles, I have built a diverse technical background while maintaining an exceptional track record of delivering impact through my full-time positions. 

I am passionate about building products and platforms that improve people's lives through technology and innovation. I work analytically and strategically, with a keen eye for detail, to solve complex problems and drive transformational change. Let's have a conversation about how we can work together to achieve something great.
